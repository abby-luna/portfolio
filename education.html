                <p>
                    St.Nessans is a primary school in Mungert. I don't have many memories from this
                    school however I feel like they adequately prepared me for Secondary School. 
                    The school had many extracurricular activities including a coderdojo class

                <p>
                    Salesians Secondary College had an interesting way of teaching that I didn't particularly 
                    agree with. The school was rather religious and prioritized it over subjects like IT.
                    Assuming you managed to get on a school computer for DCG, you were never safe there, the 
                    school used one shared account for all students (to save money). This meant that all student
                    data was visible by any other student on that machine.

                    TUS is a University with over 14,000 students on six campuses. They offer 
                    undergraduate, postgraduate, vocational, and professional training from Level 6 
                    undergraduate courses right up to Level 10 PhDs. When I choose TUS it was the only time
                    I ever got to choose my own school. And I believe I made the right choice
